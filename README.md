# Dashboard_Generator
This project visualizes and compares the historical stock prices and quarterly revenues of Tesla and GameStop using Python. Stock price data is fetched using the yfinance library, while revenue data is obtained through web scraping. 
The data is processed, cleaned, and plotted using plotly to create an interactive dashboard. 
The dashboard helps investors analyze trends, understand business performance over time, and make data-driven comparisons between a high-growth tech company (Tesla) and a retail-based gaming company (GameStop).
